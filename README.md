# Browser Polyfills Research

This repository is dedicated to a conducted research on browser polyfills.

The goal of the research is to find a most optimal way to deliver core-js polyfills to the web browsers that require it, without introducing an extra weight.

The research is underway. The results will be published online and links will be added to this repository as well as all relevant code and prototypes.

## Sponsors & Partners
